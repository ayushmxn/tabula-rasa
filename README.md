# Tabula Rasa

Tabula Rasa transforms Roman Hindi to Devanagari Hindi using Google Translate API. I frquently write Hindi poetry. I am forced to write on my mobile which has the Hindi keyboard. I am much faster on a desktop. My solution is to write it in Roman Hindi, translate it into Devanagari Hindi and export it from there.
